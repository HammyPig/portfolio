<h1>Hello, my name is James!</h1>

<h2>Welcome to my website</h2>

<p>You may be thinking to yourself: "James, what is this stupid dumb website you've made." I will respond by telling you it is the birth of something new.</p>
<p>Rather than go through the stresses of creating the perfect website on the first go, my thought process instead leapt to creating a stupid website, and evolving it along as I went.</p>
<p>So here is its first iteration in all its glory. Hopefully it has no embarassing mistakes.</p>
<p>Be kind and have fun!</p>
